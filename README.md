## Stakeholder Interview 

### Goals/needs
- Choose to interact with buyers/sellers from a specific college/university or select all nearby colleges - maybe use a filter.
- Requires pictures of items, location(maybe dorms?), and price (maybe allow swapping of items). Can include measurements, color descriptions too 
Timeframe when the seller is available to sell or swap that maybe you can filter by
- Notifications for prices, something you were looking at sells
- Profile includes what college the buyer/seller goes to
### Problems
- Not selling your item by the time you need or want because your listing is lost in the feed (fix by filtering when/where you are looking for something or by matching descriptions of what the user is looking for)
- First come first serve vs bidding wars (maybe seller sets “buy now” price and users can offer lower bids)
- Visually appealing ui to keep users from being bored/understimulated
- Difficulty moving large furniture, images can be deceiving. Maybe add weight estimate/weight rating system to help users plan around moving
- If the user feels deceived by a post they will be less likely to use the app even if it is not the apps fault
